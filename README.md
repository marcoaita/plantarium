The Plantarium is a place where plants will grow happy, with illumination controlled manually or automatically, and irrigation will happen either via rain or through in-soil irrigation, also controlled manually or automatically. There will be a little river going through the landscape (running only when we want!) and a little mill !! :-). In the future we will also control temperature and humidity.
